# Competition-Game
This was a group project work part of an assessment in university of Aberdeen that we developed the strategies and methods used to implement multi-agent system (MAS) using the language JASON

Here i will be showing the methods and approaches employed in devising strategies for implementing a multi-agent system (MAS), using a simplified rendition of the 2019 Multi-Agent Programming Contest (MAPC), encompassing various parameters and constraints. It offers insights into our team's strategies, the hurdles we encountered, and our overarching thought process throughout the project's formulation and execution.
